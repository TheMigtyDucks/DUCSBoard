# Introducing the DUCC

The DUCC is a nascent datalogging platform aiming to streamline the sensor-to-database pipeline for grassroots water quality advocates and citizen scientists.

This first iteration of the design was born of the ECE4872 Senior Design course at The Georgia Institute of technology in Spring 2021. 

This is an initial proof of concept, and further development is needed before this device is ready for adoption. Specific areas that need attention include the power supply, integration with Adafruit.io, and sensor calibration/verification.
